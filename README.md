The Poisson equation is a partial differential equation that describes the relationship between a function and its Laplacian (the sum of second partial derivatives). It is commonly used in physics and engineering, especially in electrostatics, gravitational potential theory, and heat distribution.

The general form of the Poisson equation is:

\[
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = f(\mathbf{r})
\]

Where:
- \( \nabla^2 \) is the Laplace operator (also called the Laplacian), which is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates. In three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates, it is:

\[
\nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
\]

- \( \phi(\mathbf{r}) \) is the scalar field or potential function we want to solve for (such as electric potential, gravitational potential, etc.).
- \( f(\mathbf{r}) \) is a known function, typically representing a source term, such as charge density in electrostatics or mass density in gravitational problems.

In electrostatics, for example, if \( f(\mathbf{r}) = \rho(\mathbf{r})/\epsilon_0 \), where \( \rho(\mathbf{r}) \) is the charge density and \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space, the Poisson equation becomes:

\[
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r})}{\epsilon_0}
\]

In other words, the Poisson equation provides a way to relate the distribution of sources (charge, mass, etc.) to the resulting field (electric potential, gravitational potential, etc.).
