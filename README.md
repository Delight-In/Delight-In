Certainly! Here's an example of how you could include the Poisson equation and a brief explanation of it in a README file:

# Poisson Equation Solver

This repository contains an implementation of a solver for the **Poisson equation** in various coordinate systems. The Poisson equation is a partial differential equation widely used in physics to describe the relationship between a field and its sources.

### Poisson Equation Overview

The **Poisson equation** is expressed as:

\[
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = f(\mathbf{r})
\]

Where:
- \( \nabla^2 \) is the **Laplacian operator**, which is the sum of second partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates. In 3D Cartesian coordinates, it is:
  \[
  \nabla^2 = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}
  \]
- \( \phi(\mathbf{r}) \) is the **potential field** that we aim to solve for (e.g., electric potential, gravitational potential).
- \( f(\mathbf{r}) \) is the **source term**, which can represent quantities like charge density in electrostatics or mass density in gravitational fields.

### Example in Electrostatics

In the context of electrostatics, the Poisson equation is written as:

\[
\nabla^2 \phi(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r})}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Where:
- \( \rho(\mathbf{r}) \) is the **charge density**.
- \( \epsilon_0 \) is the **permittivity of free space**.

### Purpose of This Solver

This solver is designed to compute the potential field \( \phi(\mathbf{r}) \) for a given source distribution \( f(\mathbf{r}) \), using numerical methods such as finite differences or finite element methods.

### Features

- Solves the Poisson equation in different geometries (Cartesian, spherical, cylindrical, etc.)
- Handles both constant and variable source terms.
- Provides graphical visualizations of the potential field.

### Usage Example

```python
import poisson_solver

# Example source term
source_term = lambda x, y, z: 1 / (x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

# Define grid and solve Poisson equation
phi = poisson_solver.solve_poisson(source_term, grid_size=(100, 100, 100))

# Visualize solution
poisson_solver.visualize_solution(phi)
```

This is a basic template for including the Poisson equation and related information in a README file for a Poisson equation solver project. You can expand on it further depending on your specific implementation and features.
